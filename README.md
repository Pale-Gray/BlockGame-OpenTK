# BlockGame-OpenTK
A vision and in-progress game that is similar to Hytale or Minecraft with mods.

## About

My game is going to be similar to Minecraft, but with added features and implementations that strive away from Minecraft itself

## My Vision

BlockGame will have its main core at being a voxel game. Here is what I envision it to be.

## Features

[Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) with a mixture of [Hytale](https://hytale.com/).

Aspects of the game will be similar to mods that I have played with and love:

- [Dynamic Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamictrees)
- [Dynamic Surroundings](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-surroundings)
- [Tough As Nails](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tough-as-nails)
- [Better Foliage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-foliage)
- [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons)

**All of the code involving the aspect of these mods will be *Written only by me*.**

## Things I plan on putting in the game (technical features or features that might not be inputted into the game)

- Vertex Displacement on plants, leaves, and water/liquid
- More realistic or pseudo physics on blocks
- Multiplayer
- Quests
- Natural Generation which include remains of buildings
- Shadow Mapping
- All forms of lighting that will be necessary (point and directional)
- Reflections / Psuedo Reflections using Frame Buffer Objects (FBO)
